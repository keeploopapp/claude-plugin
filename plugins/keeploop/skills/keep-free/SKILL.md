Find open time on my calendar, using the Keeploop tools.
What I need: $ARGUMENTS
(If that is empty: 30 minutes in the next five days.)

1. Read the length as duration_minutes (30m is 30, 1h is 60, 90 min is 90; 30 if none is given). Turn the range into ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) for start and end, using today's date: today, tomorrow, this week (today through the coming Friday), next week (Monday through Friday), and so on. With no range, leave start and end out. If I name hours or days (mornings, after 2pm, weekends), pass working_hours (for example "09:00-12:00") and days (for example "mon-fri" or "sat,sun"); otherwise leave them out.
2. Call find_free_time with duration_minutes, start, end, limit=10, and working_hours and days when step 1 set them.
Then list the slots grouped by day (day, then start to end time), and say the range searched. If there are none, say so and suggest a wider range or other hours. Do not add or propose events unless I ask.
If a tool is missing, is turned off in Keeploop, or answers that it needs Keeploop Pro, say so in one line and do what you can with the rest.
